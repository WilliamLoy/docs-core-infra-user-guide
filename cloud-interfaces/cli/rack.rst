Rackspace CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Command Line Interface (rack) is a unified tool you can use to manage 
your Rackspace services. 

As opposed to using different clients to perform different tasks, *rack* requires
no additional plugins to allow additional functionality with the Rackspace Cloud.
Rackspace CLI utilizes `gophercloud <http://gophercloud.io/>`__, an Openstack
compatible SDK that allows for complete functionality with most Rackspace services.

.. note::

    The Rackspace CLI is no longer actively supported or developed.

Follow the `installation and configuration <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/configuration/>`__
instructions from the `Rack CLI user guide <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rack-cli/>`__ to use *rack*.
